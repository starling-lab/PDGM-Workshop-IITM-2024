![Poster](assets/poster.png)

This repository contains the materials for the **Probabilistic Deep Generative Models Workshop** held at IIT Madras, July 3-5 2024.

## Overview
This workshop aims to introduce participants to Deep and Tractable Probabilistic Generative Models, a special class of generative models that balance expressiveness and tractability. Participants will learn about their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world applications.
